This is my cutom libft library, containing my interpretation of a wide array of clasic C functions, including my own custom printf, wich closely mimics the behaviour of the clasic printf fuction, really interesting if you always wondered how does that magical function actually works like. Please take a look at my work and let me know if you enjoyed :D
